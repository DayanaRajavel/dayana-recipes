            <b>Karuvaadu Kulambu</b> is a flavorful South Indian curry made with dried fish, brinjal, and a rich tamarind-based gravy. The dish gets its depth from a freshly ground spice mix of coriander, cumin, and red chilies, combined with aromatic fennel and roasted chana dal. The dried fish is fried to enhance its taste before being simmered in the tangy, spiced gravy. Coconut pieces add a subtle sweetness and richness, balancing the bold flavors. This traditional recipe pairs perfectly with steamed rice for a comforting and satisfying meal.
